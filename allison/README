Private Chat Room in ruby on rails 3.0
---------------------------------------

This sample will let you develop a private chatRoom using juggernaut. It push chats in realtime based on publish/subscribe model.


Resources:

TL;DR:
Have these
Nodejs - http://nodejs.org/
Redis - http://code.google.com/p/redis/
Juggernaut - https://github.com/maccman/juggernaut/
JQuery - http://mirror.ozdiy.com/assets/b8/2f96a12bc919b37e09d303b86ea1b9_1251811910.html

run redis-server
run sudo node server.js in your juggernaut folder
run rails s
run ./juggernaut_listener in rails's script folder


* make sure node is at v0.4.1 (use nvm to manage node versions). Otherwise you mgiht run into throw e nexttick exceptions
make sure you have a mysql database then you are good to go

Steps::

1. Install node-v0.2.5
	Download available at: http://nodejs.org/dist/node-v0.2.5.tar.gz
	
2  Install redis 2.0.4
	Download available at: http://code.google.com/p/redis/downloads/detail?name=redis-2.0.4.tar.gz&can=2&q=
 
3. Run Redis server
	redis-server
	
3  Install juggernaut
	git clone git://github.com/maccman/juggernaut.git --recursive
	cd juggernaut
	sudo node server.js
	
   Till this point, you would have all things in place except that juggernaut would still not be able to publish chats onto channels. This feature will get enabled after Step#5
   
4. Now you are ready to implement private chat app in RoR3. To get a sample chat application:
	git clone git://github.com/prabgupt/chatclient.git --recursive
	cd chatclient
	
5. To enable publishing by Juggernaut, run: bundle install

6. run rails server: rails server

open URLS: localhost:3000/chat/ for a channel
